<h4><u>Harry Potter</u></h4> 
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liWDX4bXVx0/UYe5oLKkzlI/AAAAAAAADKg/c84mUQaNgjo/s1600/harry_potter_portrait_by_3petits_plaisirs-d51wnhn.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p1>The story's protagonist, who progresses from a frightened wimp to a strong hero at the conclusion. Harry is scarred on the forehead by a lightning-shaped scar, and he is also scarred by the battle between good and evil magic that resulted in the scar: the standoff between the evil Voldemort and his parents, who died to preserve their son. Harry's wrath for their murders is finally revealed in the novel. As he grows older, he demonstrates that he is loving and astute, a devoted friend, and a skilled Quidditch athlete.</p1>
<br>
<h4><u>Ron Weasley</u></h4> 
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/drawittoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RON-WEASLEY-THUMB-WEBSITE-2.jpg?fit=3542%2C1667&ssl=1" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p3>A meek, humble young magician who hails from a poor wizard household. Harry's first buddy at Hogwarts is Ron, with whom he becomes close. Although he lacks Harry's zeal and charm, his dedication and assistance become invaluable to Harry during their escapades. Despite his wizard pedigree, Ron's mediocrity reminds us that Hogwarts’ success is dependent purely on skill and hard effort, not on family ties. Ron's willingness to be thrashed by the gigantic chess queen exemplifies his selflessness and generosity.</p3>
<br>
<h4><u>Hermione Granger</u></h4> 
<img src="https://img.artpal.com/09929/4-17-10-3-15-43-9m.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p4>Initially, an obnoxious goody-two-shoes who learns excessively and slavishly follows school norms. After learning to value friendship over perfection and compliance, Hermione finally becomes friends with Harry. She hails from a pure Muggle background, and her character exemplifies the social-adjustment issues that new students at Hogwarts sometimes confront.</p4>
<br>
<h4><u>Hagrid</u></h4> 
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/35/06/e53506441fe0d94ce0edb94769c6affe.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p5>A loutish giant who works at Hogwarts as a groundskeeper. Rubeus Hagrid is a well-intentioned creature with more compassion than intelligence. He loves Harry a lot, as indicated by his tears when he had to leave the baby Harry with the Dursleys. Even if it leads him into trouble, his love for animals is wonderful (as when he tries raising a dragon at home). In a world filled with cunning villains, Hagrid represents the value of kindness and human warmth.</p5>
<br>
<h4><u>Albus Dumbledore</u></h4> 
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2d7f1e23aa628c6fd5edf72d7742b351/tumblr_inline_pqtxxtQlTo1sliaqe_1280.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p6>Hogwarts' compassionate and intelligent headmaster. Despite his status as a famous wizard, Dumbledore is as kind and gentle as his name indicates. While some school authorities, such as Professor McGonagall, are concerned with the rules, Dumbledore respects them but does not overstate their importance (as his cautions against entering the Forbidden Forest remind us). He appears to possess a near-superhuman degree of intellect, knowledge, and personal insight, and it appears that he may have orchestrated the entire hunt for the Sorcerer's Stone in order for Harry to demonstrate his worth.</p6>
<br>
<h4><u>Draco Malfoy</u></h4> 
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/54/c5/c4/54c5c4a38b61b148bbeb7de1e4f93513--stones-draco.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br
<p7>Harry's antagonist and an egotistical pupil. Malfoy, whose name loosely translates to "dragon of evil faith," is a wealthy snob from a long line of wizards who believes he is owed to a Hogwarts education. He makes fun of Ron Weasley, the poorer of the two Weasley brothers, and recommends Harry pick his buddies more wisely. Malfoy gets increasingly hostile to Harry and his companions as the novel develops, and there is a suggestion that he may grow to be another Voldemort.</p7>
<br>
<h4><u>Voldemort</u></h4>
<img src="https://assets.sutori.com/user-uploads/image/24faabff-c8c2-4479-bad8-28d9903c59ab/62a580be18ce67e4520fea40bd12b933.jpeg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br
<p8>A powerful wizard who has gone rogue. Voldemort left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry after killing his parents. As a result, Voldemort has altered Harry's existence in such a way that Harry's final annihilation of him looks to be a form of retribution. Throughout the novel, Voldemort is connected with both high-flying wizardry and deception. His name in French means "flight of death" or "steal of death." He is hell-bent on locating the Sorcerer's Stone in order to avoid death. Voldemort's flaw is that he doesn't get love, thus he can't touch Harry's body, which still holds the imprints of his mother's love for her son.</p8>
<br>
<h4><u>Neville Longbottom</u></h4> 
<img src="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/neville-longbottom.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p9>Harry's quiet Hogwarts classmate. Neville is nice and loyal, although he lacks Harry's charm, as does Ron. He is initially very dutiful, much like Hermione, and when it comes time to go for the Sorcerer's Stone, he dreads punishment and threatens to denounce his pals to the professors.</p9>
<br>
<h4><u>Professor Snape</u></h4> 
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*wUzsjSLersHzwtEw.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p10>At Hogwarts, he is a professor of Potions. Severus Snape despises Harry and for the majority of the novel, he looks to be a villain. His name conjures up images of his making rash judgements about people, as well as his aggressive intents to shatter the bones of his foes. Snape's animosity towards Harry, while not deadly, serves as a reminder of the distinction between forgivable vices and unforgivable wicked intents.<p10>
<br>
<h4><u>Professor Quirrell</u></h4>
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-529e3e1b1e5f96aaa94a46f43772c9a1-lq" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p11>Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts, and a stuttering and seemingly harmless man. For most of the novel, Quirrell looked anxious and squirrelly, as his name indicates. He, for example, is the one who nearly passes out while announcing that a troll has escaped from the school. Quirrell, on the other hand, turns out to be a cold-blooded conniver who has feigned his retiring humility.</p11>
<br>
<h4><u>Professor McGonagall</u></h4>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/f4/3b/5cf43b6b354f236d59c2fdd7c31b684a.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p12>Gryffindor House Head at Hogwarts and a powerful woman in the wizarding realm. Minerva McGonagall is fair, yet her penalties are harsh and severe. Her adherence to the letter of the law is admirable, but it leaves us with the impression that she will never be as kind and wise as Dumbledore. Rowling named her after William McGonagall, a famously mediocre nineteenth-century Scottish poet who was still quite confident in his own abilities.</p12>
<br>
<h4><u>Vernon Dursley</u></h4> 
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5e/62/73/5e62739c11144ed7ebb8893a57cdca91.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p13>Harry's wealthy uncle, with whom he spends ten dreadful years. Dursley represents the Muggle world at its most mediocre and ridiculous. We first see wizards through the perspective of Mr. Dursley's jaded Muggle eyes, and his closed-mindedness toward the colourful cloaks and literate cats he encounters underscores how different the human and magical worlds are.</p13>
<br>
<h4><u>Petunia Dursley</u></h4> 
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/6c/8e/766c8ecef6a476d09ca9f2951e3df1c7.jpg" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p14>Mrs. Dursley is Mr. Dursley's wife. Petunia is like a prison-keeper to Harry and an overly protective mother to her pampered son, Dudley. She is arrogant and too worried about what her neighbours think of her and her family. When we learn that she was always envious of her sister, Lily, Harry's witch mother, and her magical abilities, she becomes more human for us. Perhaps her hatred for Harry stems from the childhood bitterness of her sister.</p14>
<br>
<h4><u>Dudley Dursley</u></h4>
<img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/3nx9InWGEYkNJFcewTi1Yy/df8f5f6d95ad768ff41dc8089900ee41/Dudley.jpg?fm=jpg&q=70&w=2560" height="200" width="300"><br> <br>
<p15>A spoiled, overweight bully who is Harry's cousin. Dudley is obnoxious and noisy, and he uses parental love to obtain what he wants—his extravagant wishes for several television sets presage the key episodes involving the Mirror of Erised and Voldemort's mistaken desire for perpetual life. Despite being less talented than Malfoy, Dudley's taunting of Harry foreshadows Malfoy's subsequent bullying habits at Hogwarts.</p15>
